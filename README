Very simple Python script for sending power data from a Current Cost
to Cosm (Pachube).

This requires my cosmSender.py module available from:
https://github.com/JackKelly/cosmSender

To use, you need to create a config.xml file in the following format:

<config>
  <apikey>YOUR PACHUBE API KEY</apikey>
  <feed>YOUR PACHUBE FEED ID</feed>
  <datastream>YOUR PACHUBE DATASTREAM</datastream>
  <serialport>THE SERIAL PORT TO WHICH YOUR CURRENT COST IS ATTACHED e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0</serialport>
</config>
