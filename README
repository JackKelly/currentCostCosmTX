Very simple Python script for sending power data from a Current Cost
to Cosm (Pachube) and also to log data to a local file.  Can handle
multiple sensors (e.g. multiple Individual Appliance Monitors).

This requires my cosmSender.py module available from:
https://github.com/JackKelly/cosmSender

To use, you need to create a config.xml file in the following format:

<config>
  <apikey>YOUR PACHUBE API KEY</apikey>
  <feed>YOUR PACHUBE FEED ID</feed>
  <datastream>YOUR PACHUBE DATASTREAM</datastream>
  <serialport>THE SERIAL PORT TO WHICH YOUR CURRENT COST IS ATTACHED
  e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0</serialport>
  <filename>THE CSV DATAFILE TO OUTPUT TO (including path)</filename>
</config>

Optionally, if you have multiple sensors connected to your CurrentCost
(for example if you're using Individual Appliance Monitors) then you
can provide the names for these appliances in sensorNames.csv
file. This is simply an ordered list of appliance names, separated by
a new line.  e.g.:

aggregate
tv
fridge
laptop
